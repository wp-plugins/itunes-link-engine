Download the iTunes Link Engine to automatically localize and affiliate iTunes product links to improve user experience and increase conversions.

== Description ==

Turn every iTunes link across your site into an opportunity for worldwide sales by instantly converting all your links to the iTunes, App Store, iBooks, and Mac App Store, into intelligent globalized links. For every click, your links will automatically redirect to the same item in a visitor’s local iTunes storefront to bridge the gap between iTunes’ geographically segmented storefronts and your international audience.    

Whether you are promoting music, TV, movies, books or apps, within the iTunes ecosystem, the iLE is the easiest way to localize and affiliate every link so that it works across every iTunes Storefront.  By “localizing” these links, you ensure all clicks from your viewers around the world are redirected to the appropriate item in their own local storefront with your affiliate ID attached. This improves the user’s experience by bringing them to the place they’re most likely to purchase, and helps you earn the commissions you deserve. 

= How is GeoRiot different? =

Most link “localization” plugins only translate a link for an international click when the same ADAM (Apple Digital Asset Management) ID exists in both storefronts.  However, due to many factors including Digital Rights licensing and the use of various distributors across different countries, the ADAM ID is not guaranteed to be the same. The iTunes Link Engine plugin uses GeoRiot’s [patented](https://www.google.com/patents/US8838767) five-step algorithm to find the metadata available from each product, and then match the product across storefronts. Our algorithm ensures that the user is sent to the most relevant product instead of sending your users to a non-existent item or an error message. 

In addition, connecting your GeoRiot account to the iTunes Link Engine gives you access to comprehensive reporting on clicks and commissions that no other plugin can offer. GeoRiot’s reports allow you to review performance metrics such as product types, click referrer, browser, device, operating system, geography, and more.

= How does the iTunes Link Engine plugin work? =

As soon as the plugin is installed and activated, your iTunes product links are instantly localized every time a user loads the page. You can even add new links to your WordPress site and each will be automatically converted without any additional work from you – just continue your normal workflow.

= How do I earn commissions from my links? =

To earn affiliate commissions, you first need to [create a GeoRiot account](http://www.georiot.com/Wordpress-Plugin/iTunes-Sign-Up), then connect it to your plugin (detailed instructions can be found in the [FAQ](https://wordpress.org/plugins/itunes-link-engine/faq/). *Note: If you want to take advantage of the affiliate ID management, and in-depth reporting, you can sign up for GeoRiot and try it out for free for 30 days.* 

Next, add your PHG affiliate ID to your GeoRiot Dashboard. Once your parameter has been added, the iTunes Link Engine will automatically add your affiliate ID to each link within your WordPress site. 

*Note:* You are NOT required to create a GeoRiot account, nor add your affiliate parameters to use this plugin. If you’re only interested in giving your international audience a better experience, this plugin can still be used for free to make sure each click gets redirected to their local storefront. 

Further, it’s important to note that the iLE plugin does not currently recognize the affiliate parameters already added to the iTunes links on your site.  In order to properly affiliate iTunes links you’ll need to do so with a correctly connected GeoRiot account.

= Key Features: =
* Automatic localization and translation of all iTunes links based off a visitor’s location.
* Simple, easy to use interface.
* One time configuration. Simply install the plugin, set up your GeoRiot account, and connect the two with an API key.  We take care of the rest.
* No need to have access to the iTunes API or build links through the iTunes Link Builder in PHG. Just paste normal iTunes links anywhere on your site (even behind images). 
* Your workflow remains the same.  No need to learn a new linking syntax, or disrupt your current flow.
* Automatically converts LinkShare, Tradedoubler, and DGM (Pro) formatted iTunes Affiliate links (from before the PHG rollout).

= What makes the iTunes Link Engine different from other Affiliate WP plugins? =
* Other plugins do not offer support for the new PHG affiliate program.
	* After iTunes made the switch to PHG in late 2013 and early 2014, similar plugins became obsolete.
* Unrivaled support from the GeoRiot team.
* No need to build links manually with a special link format. All of your links are automatically converted to localized links when the page loads.

**Please Note:** If you are already using affiliated links on your website, they will not remain affiliated if you use the iTunes Link Engine Plugin.  In order to affiliate your links, you must [sign up for a GeoRiot account](http://www.georiot.com/Wordpress-Plugin/iTunes-Sign-Up) and add your affiliate parameters to the dashboard.

= Do I have to pay for GeoRiot? =

If you’re only interested in giving your international audience a better experience by redirecting them to their local storefront, the iTunes Link Engine is completely free. 

However, if you would like access to advanced reporting features and be able to affiliate all of your links, you will need to sign up for a GeoRiot account.  Try it out for [free for 30 days](http://www.georiot.com/Wordpress-Plugin/iTunes-Sign-Up). 

Please note: By default, GeoRiot's affiliate parameters will be used until you have added your own via the GeoRiot dashboard.  Please [contact GeoRiot](mailto:contact@georiot.com) if you have any questions.

= Do I need to update the JavaScript myself? =
No, the iLE plugin is instantly pulled from a remote server each time your page loads, which means that the snippet is always up to date.  If we update the code from our end, it will instantly be updated on your website upon page load.


= Is the iTunes Link Engine compatible with other affiliate tools? =
* **Amazon Link Engine:**
The iTunes Link Engine is fully compatible with the Amazon Link Engine plugin. 

* **Skimlinks:**
The iTunes Link Engine plugin works perfectly with Skimlinks.

* **VigLink:**
The VigLink plugin, however, will overwrite the iLE and not allow your links to be globalized if it has already been installed. If you are currently using this plugin, you simply need to deactivate it from your Wordpress site, download and activate the iTunes Link Engine plugin, and then reactivate the Viglink plugin.  Once this is done, the plugins will work seamlessly together.

* **iTunes Widgets:**
The iTunes Widgets are unfortunately not compatible with this version of the iLE plugin.
